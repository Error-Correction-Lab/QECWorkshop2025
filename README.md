**Scalable QCE Workshop @ IEEE QCE 2025**

This GitHub page contains the code for the website for the Scalable Quantum Error Correction Workshop 2025. 

The Scalable Quantum Error Correction (QEC) workshop will be a part of the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE) 2025, the premier international conference dedicated to all aspects of quantum computing and engineering, held in 2025. The goal of this workshop is to explore scalable quantum error correction techniques for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The event will feature invited talks from researchers and industry leaders at the forefront of this field, as well as a concluding panel discussion focused on identifying key open problems—both foundational and practical—in scaling QEC systems. We will also explore recent results and advances that bring us closer to building scalable and implementable quantum error correction.
