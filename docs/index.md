## Workshop Theme and Objectives

The goal of this workshop is to explore scalable quantum error correction techniques for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The event will feature invited talks from researchers and industry leaders at the forefront of this field, as well as a concluding panel discussion focused on identifying key open problems—both foundational and practical—in scaling QEC systems. We will also explore recent results and advances that bring us closer to building scalable and implementable quantum error correction.
